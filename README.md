Validated on 01-03-2022.\

This project aims to broaden the knowledge of system administration by using Docker.\
It is a completely pre-configured LEMP stack with Docker-Compose. Nginx, Wordpress and Mariadb+php run in seperate containers.\
The docker images were built by me, no ready-made images were used.
